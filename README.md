## Introduction
Superstore is a retail business that specializes in selling a wide range of consumer products including technology, furniture, and office supplies. Over the years, it has consistently maintained a strong profit margin, averaging around 70%. Analyzing Superstore’s sales data provides valuable insights into hidden trends and customer behaviors across different market segments. The dataset spans a 3-year period and captures transactions from customers across various job industries and income levels, helping to uncover patterns in purchasing habits, product performance, and regional sales dynamics.

## Data Collection
The data was collected from the company’s sales department, which was dirty and needed to be cleaned for accurate decision making. The dataset contains 1952 rows and 23 columns. The Columns contains: Row Id, Order Id, Discount. Profit. Discount. Quantity Ordered, Unit Price, Shipping Cost and so on.

## Data Cleaning
The Analysis was performed on Power Bi. The Raw data collected was dirty and it needed some thorough excel cleaning function to be Clean and accurate. Here are some cleaning steps taken to perform this task:
•	Replacing blank Cells: Some cells in the 'Product base margin' column were discovered to be blank; these blank cells were replaced with the average of the column.

## Insight and Analysis
•	East region is the most profitable (85K), while South region runs at a loss (-14K).

•	Technology leads in sales volume. Office Supplies contributes significantly to order quantity but lower profit.

•	Some sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases are operating at a loss even before shipping.

•	Delivery Truck and Express Air are faster and more frequently used by profitable segments while Regular Air is heavily used by Corporate but might be inflating shipping costs.

•	Profit peaks in May and June 2015, with the lowest in March 2015 (0 profit).

•	High discounts (e.g., Erin Ballard with 17.89%) are still profitable—indicating strategic discounting can work.


## Recommendation 
•	Reduce Focus on Unprofitable Product, discontinue or reprice least profitable items like Polycom ViewStation and Okidata Pacemark.

•	Increase marketing efforts to Small Business and Home Office segments.

•	Implement strategies that made East, Central and West Region into the South Region to improve the profit, also consider logistics, pricing, or demand issues.

•	Reward high-value customers with loyalty (e.g., Andrew Levine, Erin Ballard).

•	Adjust Pricing and run a target promotion in the underperforming region.

•	Partner with faster logistics providers or streamline fulfillment in high-delay regions.

•	Focus on high-profit, high-sales items like Phones, Chairs, and Copiers. Increase visibility through targeted ads, email campaigns, and prominent placement on the website or store. Ensure consistent stock availability to avoid losing sales due to stockouts.

•	Spend more money on ads and keep enough stock of the items that sell well and make good profit.
